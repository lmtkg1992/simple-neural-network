# Simple Neural Network

This is simple neural network for predict function from given training data set.

## How to use
### 1. Generate data set
Edit secret function at function secret_function() and generate practical data set into data_set.csv file

```
python run.py generate
```
### 2. Training data set and predict output
You can remove some rows in data_set.csv file and use them as testing data.

Input value testing input at function get_test_data() and run below command.

```
python run.py
```
